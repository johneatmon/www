In the last 2 years, I’ve designed and scrapped countless iterations of this site. As soon as I began coding my designs, I’d begin to hate what I’d created. Over and over again. All of that ends today.

Today, I’m writing the _first_ post for the _first_, real iteration of my personal site. And it’s not being scrapped, it’s being published.

This site doesn’t have all the bells and whistles that other developer sites do, but at least the site is finally real.

I’m going to allow myself a small bit of pride for finally getting something out in the wild. It may not be perfect, but it is a start.
