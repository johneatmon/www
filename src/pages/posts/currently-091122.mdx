On Labor Day weekend, I completed a challenging hike I'd been training for the past month or so. I hiked up to [Camp Muir](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2022-09-05.6438272162) on Mt. Rainier. The weather was absolutely gorgeous, and could not have been more perfect. I used this hike as a litmus test for more challenging adventures. If the weather cooperates, my goal is to summit Mt. Adams before the end of September. Although, with the wildfire conditions at present, this may not be possible.

## Listening

I'm currently enjoying the newly-released album _Stellar Drifting_ by George Fitzgerald. I loved his album _All That Must Be_, released back in 2018.

## Watching

I finished all three seasons of _The Boys_. I'm now watching the new LOTR _The Rings of Power_ show. It's...okay. My gripes are with editing, especially in the first episode (I do not share the same complaints as those review-bombing the show for political reasons).

## Reading

I'm reading again! Not books currently but personal blogs. I love the bite-sized, practical tidbits offered by the community. With all of these news "frameworks" out (Astro, Fresh, 11ty, Enhance), I'm seeing a revival of interest in the personal blog. You love to see it. Some choice articles I've found particularly enlightning lately:

- ["The web is a harsh manager"](https://daverupert.com/2022/08/web-is-a-harsh-manager/) by Dave Rupert
- ["WCAG, but in language I can understand"](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/wcag-but-in-language-i-can-understand) by Martin Underhill
- ["Write Well"](https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro) by Julian Shapiro

## Other

I worked on refactoring my blog, going for a more Spartan feel. It's an open work-in-progress, and there's much more to be done to improve performance, accessibility, and whimsy. I licensed the typeface SÃ¶hne, which just goes a long way to make my site feel more special. It's open-source as well, you can [view the source on GitHub](https://github.com/jmaeat/www).
