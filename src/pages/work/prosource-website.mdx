## User Research

I started by researching our buyers. Using a combination of secondary research and data from a client survey, I analyzed our customer demographics and challenges. I used this information to determine how we could position our website to better speak to the needs and challenges of buyers. Additionally, this process highlighted ways we could improve the experience for existing customers, too.

Underneath, there are 4 columns, each with a heading and paragraph. The column reads: Primarily healthcare or healthcare-adjacent, We found that over 50% of the customer base was in the healthcare industry or a healthcare-adjacent field. The second column reads: Key stakeholders were predominantly women, Many of the surveyed stakeholders were office/practice managers or CFOs, and were predominantly women. The third column reads: Based in Central FL despite nationwide message, Despite nationwide messaging/positioning, the overwhelming majority of customers were based in Orlando, FL. The fourth and final column reads: Became a client because they were unhappy, Surveyed customers became ProSource customers because they were unhappy or underserved from their previous provider.',

### User Personas

After researching our users, I helped develop personas in collaboration with the business development team. This process helped us understand the needs of our customers and how our redesigned website could serve their needs better. The rationale was: if we could improve the site for our current customers, then we would likely be improving the design for _future_ customers, too.

Challenges – 1) Ensuring smooth office operations 2) HIPAA compliance 3) Limited authority to approve changes. Demographics – Age, 42; Income, $70–90K; Education, AA or BA/BS.

## Information Architecture

### Content Audit

I took stock of all existing content by running a content audit. I tagged everything with a simple RAG status: red was unsalvageable, amber required major edits, and green meant it was either good to go or required minor edits. Very little was salvageable from previous website iterations.

### Sitemap

I created a sitemap and sorted salvageable content under the appropriate page. We outsourced copy for critical pages to an outside marketing firm to speed things up.

		alt: "A slide showcasing the sitemap. There are four columns, each with a heading and bullet points underneath representing links or webpages. The first column heading is Primary navigation. Under it: Homepage; About Us (mega-menu) with sub-bullets: About Us (page), Our Team (link to section), Our Values, Our Partners, Careers, and News/Updates; Our Services; Industries with a sub-bullet: Healthcare, Finance, Engineering, Manufacturing; Resources (mega-menu) with sub-bullets: Resources (page), Customer Stories, Blog, Guides and eBooks, and Webinars (Ask a Pro); Contact Us; CTA: Let's Chat. The second column heading is Footer navigation. Under it: Services (links to page sections) with sub-bullets: Outsourced IT, IT Augmentation, Cyber Security, Cloud Services, Voice Services, and IT Projects/IT Consulting; Industries with sub-bullets: Healthcare, Engineering, Finance, and Manufacturing; Resources with sub-bullets: Blog, Customer Stories, Guides & eBooks, and Webinars. The third column heading is Footer navigation (cont.). Under it: Support with sub-bullets: Contact Us, Cloud Password Reset, TR Onboarding Form, 2FA Enrollment, Sitemap; Company with sub-bullets: About Us, Careers, News & Updates, Our Partners, Terms & Conditions with sub-bullets: MSA, Hosted Services, Managed IT Services, Voice Services; and Privacy Policy. The fourth, and final, column heading is Taxonomies. Under it: News & Updates with sub-bullets: Press Release, Employee Spotlight, Partner Spotlight, Service Update; Blog with sub-bullets: Cloud, Cyber Security, Data Management, (Managed) IT, and vCIO strategies; Customer Stories (Case Studies) with sub-bullets: Healthcare, Engineering, Finance, and Manufacturing; and Guides & eBooks with sub-bullets: Cloud, Cyber Security, and (Managed) IT.",

	phase.

## Wireframes

I created wireframes in Figma. This helped me determine the amount of marketing copy needed for each page. After I finished each page, I sent it to a small group of customers and peers for feedback and testing. The feedback helped us reduce IT jargon and build a more approachable design — brighter colors, larger type size, and more relatable imagery.

In this phase, wireframes were halfway between low- and high-fidelity. They were not pixel-perfect, as I left a little wiggle room for last-minute adjustments during development.

## Development

Development began in mid-summer 2021. By late August, things were firing on all cylinders. In early September, the new site launched to coincide with our rebrand debut. It was a massive amount of work, but I managed to pull it off with the help of my team.

### Tech Stack

The following technologies were used to create the website:

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) — a new static-site generator that promises "powerful developer experience."
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) — the utility-first CSS framework.
- [Netlify + Functions & Forms](https://www.netlify.com/) — a [jamstack](https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/)-focused platform.

## Conclusion

If I had more time, I would have conducted usability tests. When we asked for feedback, customers/peers merely reviewed the website on their own time and jotted down a few thoughts — there weren't a set of tasks to complete to highlight flow pain points.

If you're curious, you can see some of the earlier iterations of the website below:

Overall, I am pleased with how the redesign turned out, especially given the tight deadline.

### Outcomes

- Redesigned over 60 pages of content to align with brand attributes and user personas
- Addressed core challenges brought up in customer/peers feedback
- Better information architecture for content and taxonomies: blog, customer stories, videos, webinars, etc.
