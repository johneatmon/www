## Background

Hosting desktop versions of QuickBooks is a core offering of ProSource. When ProSource became an [Intuit Authorized Hosting Service Provider](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/help-article/product-setup/hosting-providers-authorized-intuit/L3RAbICtq_US_en_US), the company wanted a dedicated landing page to track and convert leads generated from the Intuit website.

The QuickBooks landing page was the first designed for a specific niche â€” another was created for the [Florida Radiological Society conference](https://www.flrad.org/2022-annual-meeting-frs-frbma/) ProSource attended in July 2022.
