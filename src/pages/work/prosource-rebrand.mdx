## Background

When I started at ProSource, the company pitched itself as a soup to nuts IT provider for every industry. As the team complexity changed and became more specialized, our client demographic shifted. By 2021, over half of our clients were in healthcare or a healthcare-adjacent industry.

To capitalize on this high-complexity industry — and other industries with similar complexity — where we knew our impact would be greatest, we overhauled the ProSource brand to refocus our marketing efforts.

## Brand Attributes

In collaboration with the leadership team, we created all new brand attributes based on these characteristics:

- **Culture** — how we want other customers to perceive us.
- **Customer** — how we describe our target customers.
- **Voice** — our tone when we communicate with customers.
- **Benefit** — how we help customers with our services.
- **Value** — the measurable impact our customers receive from us.
- **X-Factor** — what separates us from the competition.

### Mission Statement

> Thoughtful IT solutions that put people first.
> I also helped develop [a culture guide](https://www.getprosource.com/about-us/our-values/) to help us actualize these new brand attributes.

### Target Customers

Our bread and butter was healthcare or healthcare-adjacent companies. Eventually, we expanded our focus to include engineering, finance, and manufacturing customers.

We created user personas for the new brand, which helped during the website redesign process. You can [read more about the user personas here](/work/prosource-website#user-personas).

## Redesigned Assets

Working closely with a logo designer, I helped shape the design of the new ProSource logo. I identified a new typeface for our digital assets. The logo and all ProSource content are set in [Moderat by TIGHTYPE](https://tightype.com/typefaces/moderat). I chose it for its geometric shape, which suits a technology company well. It's playful, too, without looking cheap. Overall, the new typeface and the simplified ProSource logomark lend to a much more approachable design.

After our new brand was formalized, I began the process of updating all marketing/sales assets with the new colors, typography guidelines, and logo.

	You may notice 1s and 0s on the contact details side — it says ProSource in binary.

## Design System To expedite website development, I created a basic design system with reusable components:

- Typography and type scale
- Colors — in light/dark modes
- Spacing system
- Button system
- Some reusable [molecules and organisms](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/ui-design/atomic-design-principles-methodology-101/), like mega-menus and footers

## Tools & Technologies The following tools and technologies were used for the ProSource rebrand project:

- Adobe Creative Cloud suite (InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
- [Maizzle](https://maizzle.com/)

## Conclusion

Our new brand feels more premium than the outgoing design. We've received many comments from customers saying we look like a 100-person company, not a plucky dozen. Some are quite shocked when they discover our team size. The new brand, collateral, and websites distinguish ProSource from other IT companies in its size.

### Outcomes

- Redesigned over 45 web/print/digital/uniform brand assets and updated all internal tools with the new brand logo, colors, and typeface.
- Redesigned over 60 employee email signatures, newsletter templates, invoice email templates and help desk ticket templates with the new brand design.
- Created a basic design system with reusable components for website projects.
